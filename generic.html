							<h2>Character Analysis</h2>
							<p>Using the MBTI personalities to assess Barbenheimer</p>
						</header>
						<section class="wrapper style5">
							<div class="inner">
								<p>We’ve spent quite some type looking at the movie genres and the general sentiment analysis. Now we come to the heroes and anti-heroes of the stories. They form the foundation for the course of the story. We root for them, whereby a wide range of emotions are triggered: we laugh, shriek, giggle, cry or even hide behind a pillow if we feel like we can’t watch what comes next. The captivating story conveyed by the characters makes us curious to see what will happen next, whether they will manage to overcome the big hurdle before time runs out, or whether there will be a happy ending and the long-awaited kiss after all.</p>

								<h3>What is MBTI?</h3>
								<p>The added data contains the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) for the characters in the original data set. The MBTI is the result of a test that analyzes psychological preferences such as decision-making and how the observed individual perceives the world. The character types were based on Carl Jung's Psychological Types. 
									Here are some key element of the MBTI character types:</p>
								<p>E vs. I → Extroverted vs. Introverted<br>S vs. N → Sensing vs. Intuitive<br>T vs. F → Thinking vs. Feeling<br>J vs. P → Judging vs. Percieving</p> 
									
								<p>If you want to learn more about the the character types visit our <a href=moreinfo.html>More Info</a> page.</p>
								<p>The personality type can be categorized by taking and evaluating a questionnaire. Try it yourself! You might be happy (or confused), to see which character best describes you… But before, come on this short journey to learn some more about the different character types in movies how trends changed over time, and how Barbenheimer compares.</p>

					

								<hr />

								<h4>Research Questions</h4>
								<p>These were the following questions identified that we aimed to discuss in this section:<br>
									<ul>
										<li>Which characters have grossed the highest?</li>
										<li>How does the prevalence of characters in movies compare to that of society?</li>
										<li>What character personality is most prominent in movies?</li>
									  </ul></p>
							
									  <hr />

								<p>Barbie is very happy, outgoing, supportive and overall spreads a lot of positive energy. She holds her community together, hosts many social events and thereby demonstrated good manners and hospitatily.
	Throughout the movie we can see some character development where also other apects of the ESFJ character type get to shine: Barbie builds a lasting relationship tot he two humans she gets in contact with – which is also why she has the doubts in the fist place, as she had a listening ear for her owner in the real world. Even after all these years she way loyal to that owner and lent a helping hand to re-connect mother and daughter and spread some joy.  
	In full ESFJ character Barbie does not appreciate it when she gets accused of being uncool and her help unwanted in the real world. In the end Barbie can find some fulfillment by joining the challenges of the real world and setting an example for reaching goals that (especially young girls) set their mind to and bringing people together in the process. </p>
